No rights reserved.
I maintain no copyright or patent restrictions on any of my creative work. As far as copyright and patent law are concerned, I grant you irrevocable permission to do anything with my work that you wish. This is a perfectly free, noncopyleft licence. For example, you may:
redistribute the work;
create and distribute a derivative work;
translate the work and distribute the translation;
edit the work and distribute the edited version;
combine the work with other works and distribute the result;
aggregate the work in a distribution with other works;
charge whatever the market will bear for the above.
Some of the creative work that I produce is a modification derived from other persons' previous work. Since the other persons may reserve legal rights to their work, you might not have legal permission to do what you want with my work, even as far as copyright and patent law are concerned. But that could only be because you did not have permission from the other persons; you already have permission from me.

I request that you give me credit for my work, and that you offer any derivative works and so forth to other people with no conditions, as I have offered this work to you with no conditions. But I will not enforce these requests legally; they are not requirements. You will have to decide for yourself.
